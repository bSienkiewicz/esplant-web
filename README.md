The ESPlant Dashboard is a Nuxt.js-based web application designed to monitor and manage plant-related data in real-time. As a part of the ESPlant system, this dashboard provides users with insights into soil moisture levels and water tank levels, displayed in graphical format. Users can configure thresholds for soil moisture and monitor historical data stored in a MongoDB database hosted on MongoDB Atlas. The dashboard communicates with the backend server to display live data and allow users to make configuration adjustments seamlessly.

## Features
- Real-time Monitoring: Displays live data of soil moisture percentage and water tank level percentage.
- Threshold Configuration: Allows users to set minimum and maximum thresholds for soil moisture.
- Historical Data: Provides access to historical data stored in a MongoDB database for analysis.
- User-friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation and data visualization.
